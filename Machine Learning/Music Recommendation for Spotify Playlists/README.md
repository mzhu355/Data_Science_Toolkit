## Project Title: Machine Learning-Based Engine Model for Playlist Song Recommendation Using Spotify Data

This is a course project for "ISYE 6740: Computational Data Analysis/Machine Learning" at Georgia Institute of Technology. The folder only includes code samples for model fitting and data manipulation.

### Description
Music has become an integral part of people's lives, and that is why a fierce competition exists among music streaming services. To stand out in this business, companies must offer unique features, and a critical one is providing effective recommendations. This project leverages on two key sources of information provided by Spotify: i) one million playlists and ii) 50,000 songs with different attributes. Based on this data, we propose, assess, and compare four different techniques for generating recommendations. Simultaneously, we share the valuable lessons learned from each technique. Our findings lead us to recommend a hybrid method that involves extensive data preprocessing, and after this preprocessing phase, we apply the Random Forest algorithm to achieve satisfactory results.
