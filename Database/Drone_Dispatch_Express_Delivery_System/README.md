# Project Title: Drone Dispatch Express Delivery System

### Description:
The project intends to design and develop a system to monitor deliveries of grocery products to customers. The system will support a "third party" grocery service. Customers will place orders with the service. The service will coordinate with grocery stores to find the products and arrange for a drone to deliver the products to the customer. On delivery, the store will be paid electronically by the customer. Tables with sample data will be created first. Then there will be stored procedures which allow the system operators to modify the database state in accordance with the main use case (such as taking orders & delivering groceries). There will also be views to provide information to the system operators about the database state from various "points of view" (i.e., system operator roles)
